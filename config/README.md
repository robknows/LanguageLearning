# Configuration Assumptions

- Frontend, analytics, server, db are all running on the same machine
- That machine is a linux or mac machine.

 To create a `apprc` environment variable file:

- Create a config file called `cfg` in this directory (example: `cfg.example`)
- In this directory, run `q create_env_configuration_script.q`
