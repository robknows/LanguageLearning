# Server

This is where I will be rewriting the Go server using Kotlin and http4k.

# Building and running.

Note that in Intellij, you need to have a java SDK selected as the project SDK otherwise it will complain.

You can build and run from the command line by running `./jar` followed by `./run`, but it will not work unless it
has access to both the legacy server and neo4j.
